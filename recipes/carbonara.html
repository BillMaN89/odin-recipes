        <img src="../images/carbonara.jpg">

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>One of the most famous Italian dishes (besides pizza) but with a twist!</p>
        <p>The Greek style carbonara has some key differences from the original, as you can see below.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <p>In order to prepare this dish, you are going to need the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>500 gr spaghetti</li>
            <li>150 gr. bacon, slices</li>
            <li>150 gr. champinion mushrooms</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>330 gr. light cream</li>

        <h3>To serve</h3>

            <li>150 gr. parmesan cheese, grated</li>
            <li>pepper, freshly ground</li>
            <li>parsley, finely chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a pot over high heat, fill it with water, and bring it to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add some salt and the pasta, and boil it according to the packet’s instructions.</li>
            <li>Stack the bacon slices together and cut them into thin strips.</li>
            <li>Place a frying pan over high heat and let it heat up well.</li>
            <li>Add the olive oil and the bacon to the pan. (If the bacon is quite fatty, you will not need the olive oil.)</li>
            <li>Add the mushrooms and sauté them for 4-5 minutes until nicely browned.</li>
            <li>Add the whole clove of garlic and the heavy cream, and mix well.</li>
            <li>Allow 1-2 minutes for the sauce to come to a boil. (You do not want the sauce to thicken a lot at this point).</li>
            <li>Remove the pot from the heat, drain the pasta, and reserve the water.</li>
            <li>Add the pasta to the pan and mix well. (If the sauce needs more moisture, add a little of the pasta water you reserved.)</li>
            <li>Take out the garlic and remove the pan from the heat.</li>
            <li>Divide the pasta among plates and serve with grated cheese, freshly ground pepper, and finely chopped parsley.</li>
        </ol>
