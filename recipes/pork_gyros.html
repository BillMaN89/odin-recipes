        <li>Souvlaki pita breads</li>
        <li>Greek tzatziki sauce</li>
        <li>Tomato slices</li>
        <li>Onion, slices</li>
        <li>Parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>French fries</li>
        <li>Mustard</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the vinegar, olive oil, salt, cumin, pepper, paprika, oregano, and garlic into a bowl.</li>
            <li>Finely chop the onion and add it to the bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the mustard, mix the ingredients with a spoon, and set the bowl aside.</li>
            <li>Place the pork chops on a cutting board and pound them with a meat tenderizer to make them very thin. Alternatively, ask your butcher to do that.</li>
            <li>Transfer the pork chops to the bowl with the marinade, mix them with your hands to marinate them well, and put them in a baking pan.</li>
            <li>Cover the pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for at least 4 hours. (You can leave the pork chops in the refrigerator even overnight.)</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the refrigerator and use a pair of tongs to transfer half of the pork chops to the air fryer’s basket, making sure they are not touching each other.</li>
            <li>Cook the pork chops at 200°C(390°F) for 8 minutes on each side, and follow the same process for the remaining pork chops.</li>
            <li>Transfer the pork chops to a cutting board and finely chop them to make the gyros.</li>
            <li>Serve in pita breads along with tzatziki sauce, tomato slices, onion slices, finely chopped parsley, French fries, and mustard.</li>
        </ol>
